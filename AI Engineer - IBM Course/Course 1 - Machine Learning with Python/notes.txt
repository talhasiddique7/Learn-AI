Course - Machine Learning with Python
Module 01:
Machine Learning algorithms
	Regression
		Simple Linear Regression
		Multiple Linear Regression
		Regression trees 
	Classification
		logistic Regression
		KNN
		SVM
		Multiclass Prediction
		Decision tree
	Clustering
		K-means
Python  libraries in Machine Learning
	Numpy
	Pandas
	Scipy
	Scikit learn
	Matplotlib

Supervised and unsupervised
	Supervised:
		teaching model on labeled data
		train model on both train and test data
	unsupervised:
		train on datasets (unlabeled)
		clustering
		dimensional reduction
		
Module 02:
	Regression
		process of predict continuous numbers
		dependent variables  = y
		Independent variables = m,x, and c
		y = mx + c 
		
		Simple Regression
			Simple linear 
			Simple non Linear
		Multiple Regression
			multiple linear
			multiple non linear
		Applications
			predict price
			employment income
		
		Evaluation Matrix
			MSE
			MAE
			RMSE
			train/test split
			high training rate can cause over fitting a model
			low performance on training and testing cause under fit model

Module 03:
	Classification
		predicting variable is categorical
	K-Nearest Neighbours
	Decision Tree
	Evaluation matrix for classification
		F1 score
		log loss

Module 04:
	logistic Regression
		what,what problem solved and which situation used
		use linear regression & Logistic Regression in binary problem??
	Support Vector Machine
		why SVM than Logistic Regression	
	Multi class Prediction
		explain

Module 05:
	K means Clustering
		what is clustering
